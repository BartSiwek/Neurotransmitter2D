# Neurotransmitter2D
Neurotransmitter2D is project developed in 2009 as a part of MSc in Computer Science.

Calculations done using this code were used to publish a paper "[Numerical simulation for a neurotransmitter transport model in the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00422-010-0380-z)"
